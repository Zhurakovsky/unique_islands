[C Exercise]

You have a 2 dimentional map with a certain width and height
At coordinates x, y the map can be either "@" or "."
For example the structure:

{
  width = 4
  height = 4
  data = "@@....@@..@@.@@@"
}

Represents the map:

  @@..
  ..@@
  ..@@
  .@@@
 
An island is a contiguous group of "@" symbols
In the above example there are two islands: in the top-left and bottom-right corners
(Two "@" in diagonal are not considered from the same island)
Your objective is to rename each island with a distinct letter
A valid solution would be:

  AA..
  ..BB
  ..BB
  .BBB
To do so, you will implement the body of two functions:
  - "display_map": Displays the 2D map by printing on the standard output
  - "process_map": Transforms the map by giving a unique letter to each island
